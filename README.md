# ACCIDENT-PREVENTION-IDENTIFICATION-AND-ALERTING
When an individual riding his/her bike , enters an accident
prone areas(areas where usually many accidents occur due to sharp turns,
ditches etc in the road) or he over speeds his bike in some restricted area, there
is chance that if he is notified about the dangers ahead, he might escape the
accident. This system will surely help to serve that purpose.
In the worst case if he/she meets with an accident, there is a
chance that the individual may suffer from a serious injury or expire
instantaneously and there is no one around to help him. Well this system is a
solution to the problem. The system acts as an accident identification system that
gathers and sends this vehicle information that met with an accident, and
conveys it to the nearest control room/ hospital/ or any friend or family
member.
